So, as we can see by the results of the test, the append function is much quicker.
The reason being is that .push is just pushing to the end of the array while 
.unshift is putting the new value at the start of the array, shfiting all the other values
over one index, therefore looping through the entire array each time it executes. 

Results for the extraLargeArray
insert 768.932167 ms
append 1.863833 ms

Results for the LargeArray
insert 6.474709 ms
append 417.125 μs

Results for the mediumArray
insert 117.75 μs
append 81.042 μs

Results for the smallArray
insert 32.5 μs
append 77.917 μs

Results for the tinyArray
insert 22.292 μs
append 76.791 μs

As you can see, when there is less indexs for each function to run through, the insert function (.unshift)
becomes much faster than append (.push). Just as the arrays become larger, so does the run time for the insert
function. Append is better for bigger arrays while insert is better for smaller arrays. Append scales much better.
